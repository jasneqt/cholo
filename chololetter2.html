  <p style="font-size: 20px">Bab, Alam mo ba, Random Thought lang. Naalala ko dati na apaka zodiac fanatic ko. Like, I was so obsessed with zodiac signs and everything, and I always see sa mga zodiac ships are aquarius x libra and I was so sad because ang aquarius lang na kilala ko that time is si greggy(friend ni puatu namapahawak)lang nakikilala ko na aquarius so like parang ako si halaaa ayoko siya, pero like parang nagcommit ako sa aquarius, like tumatak na sa isip ko na aquarius magiging bf ko soon and ayun, I'm just happy that I got the best aquarius boy in the world. Next, mitski phase, sabe ko sa sarili ko na kung jojowa man ako gusto ko nakakatawa, (di to commitment, isang beses lang syang pumasok sa isip ko) kase ang lungkutin kong tao kaya pano nalang kung parehas kaming sad boy, and now I have the funniest bf in the world. Next part, is my little wishes na isang beses lang dumaan sa isip ko, I wished for someone to be my exercise buddy, I wished for someone to give tips about studying, I wished for someone to live with in the future, someone to be my duo, to be my partner in crime, to be my bestfriend, someone to share my interest with mitski, someone to dance with, someone to have jokes with, to flirt with, to tell memories with, someone that's an aquarius, someone to love me no matter what. All the those I wished, I wished them without even thinking that that person could be my future bf, and guess what, there you are again. Everything I wished for, manifested of, thinked of is you. You are the one I've been searching for my whole life. It's just a blessing to be inlove and loved by the person I have always wanted and wished for. Thank you for being my bab, marcelo jesus e. rosal, I love you so so so so so so so so much. kisses</p>
